# Problem Statement 
To inform the business of the impact of campaigns on this title’s performance, and to support the planning of future campaigns, you should:
1. Provide an overview of XYZ's overall performance and its evolution through time using the right metrics
2. Identify when the various XYZ Marketing and LiveOps campaigns were live, justifying your results by providing data-backed proofs
3. Identify and present the effects of these campaigns on XYZ’s performance with adequate measures using the metrics provided
4. Clearly communicate insights, and provide your reasoning for why some campaigns performed better than others

## Overview:
Compared to 2026, in 2027 even though the daily active users (DAU), Quests and Median Time Played has increased by almost 25%, the sales of  game units dropped by 66%,
microtransactions(MTX’s) and Downloadable contents(DLC’s) dropped by 17% and Revenue has dropped by almost 63%.

## Marketing & LiveOps Campaigns:
You said that “Marketing or LiveOps Campaigns attract new players to the game, as well as keeping existing players engaged”. So, I am considering that they are conducted 
when there is an increase in all the three(time,users and quests) because any one of them may change due to other reasons that we may not be aware of. So, from the below 
graph we can clearly see that the campaigns are conducted in 5,8,10,12 (high spike) months of year 2026.
#### Note: Below graphs give mean values of the month

## Effects of Marketing & LiveOps Campaigns:
If you see the below graphs, 5th and 10th month campaigns have worked well as the sales of Game and “DLC’s & MTX’s” have increased. In 12th month campaign the sales of “DLC’s & MTX’s” have increased while the sales of game dropped. In the 8th month campaign sales of both of them have dropped.

## Conclusion:
I don’t think I can give you an accurate answer as to why the 8th month sales have dropped even though  the daily active users (DAU), Quests and Median Time Played have increased. But, given the data I can say that in 12th month due to Christmas & holidays there is a huge spike in sales of “DLC’s & MTX’s” and Daily Active Users(DAU).
