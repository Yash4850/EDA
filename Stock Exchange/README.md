# Problem Statement
The file data_sample.csv contains codified features of informational messages that are being produced by a subset of our servers. Each entry (row) corresponds to a particular 
informational message that we have received; it contains the UTC timestamp (datetime column) and 3 features (application, node-name and category). Messages themselves are 
excluded from the dataset. I was asked to produce a high-level summary of any regularly occurring patterns that you may find in this dataset. 
# Insights
- Between 4a.m to 6a.m, the number of applications from Monday to Saturday is at the lowest point of the day.
